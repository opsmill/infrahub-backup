title: Infrahub Operations Tool
---

The Infrahub Operations Tool provides essential maintenance capabilities for managing your Infrahub infrastructure. Whether you're backing up critical data, performing routine housekeeping, or troubleshooting issues, this tool streamlines operational tasks for Infrahub deployments.

## Overview

Data within Infrahub spans across its Neo4j database, PostgreSQL database for its task manager, and artifact storage; without reliable backups your entire infrastructure state is at risk.

Whether you deploy with Docker, Kubernetes, or a custom stack, the Operations Tool normalizes the workflow—coordinating consistent snapshots across services, validating the results, orchestrating full restores, and exercising test restores so you know backups actually work when you need them.

Routine maintenance tasks—like cleaning old log entries or pruning stale jobs—also add up. The Operations Tool automates that housekeeping so your environment stays healthy.
