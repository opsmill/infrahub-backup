title: Infrahub Backup & Restore Tool
---

## Overview

Data within Infrahub spans across its Neo4j database, PostgreSQL database for its task manager, and artifact storage; without reliable backups your entire infrastructure state is at risk.

Whether you deploy with Docker, Kubernetes, or a custom stack, the Infrahub Backup & Restore Tool normalizes the workflow—coordinating consistent snapshots across services, validating the results, orchestrating full restores, and exercising test restores so you know backups actually work when you need them.
